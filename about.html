Hello there, I'm glad that you've taken an interest into who I am. Well let me start off my saying
that I have many different hobbys, I love my radios, both the kind you listen to, aswell as the kind you talk on.
I also really like my cars, as a mechanic by profession I love working on an talking about cars.
I also love Video Games, that has been one of the things that have occupied the most of my time for the last
few years. Nothing but video games and cars, all you really need right. I am soon going to be getting into the amateur radio side of
things on my youtube channel, I am going to be going out soon and purchasing a CB radio to start making videos with, aswell as the
 gaming and car videos that I normally put out.
